                    <p>The site you are currently on is made by me! This project is a dynamic and responsive website built using React. 
                        The website is designed to provide an engaging user experience with smooth navigation and modern UI components.
                        This site was deployed using Render. Render is a cloud platform that aides in the deployment and scaling of web applications.
                        It provides a reliable and scalable hosting solution, ensuring high availability and performance for the website. 
                        The code for this website is <a href = "https://github.com/evabth/portfolio">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>This project involves creating, training, and testing a neural network to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST database. 
                        The implementation was done using PyTorch, a popular deep learning library. With PyTorch, I made a neural network capable of classifying digits from 0 to 9 with high accuracy, 
                        leveraging the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. 
                        The model was trained on thousands of unique images from the dataset. Then the model was tested using new photos that it has never encountered before. After training, 
                        the model's accuracy was 96%, demonstrating its effectiveness in digit classification.

                    <p>This school project involves the development of MicroCaml, a dynamically-typed programming language inspired by OCaml but with a subset of its features. 
                        The project aims to replicate some of the core functionalities of OCaml while introducing dynamic typing. 
                        The implementation includes a lexer, parser, and evaluator to process and execute MicroCaml code. 
                        Additionally, the project features mutop (Î¼top or Microtop), a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment similar to utop, specifically designed for MicroCaml. 
                        This project is written in OCaml and uses regex extensively in the lexer section of the code.
